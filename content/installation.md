## **Before the workshop:**

1. Download [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
2. Open Cursor and if you get the prompt to install "command line tools" please do that. It will take 10 minutes
3. Sign up for an account (Free trial is okay for the course) 

## Window Users

You'll have an additional step to install "GIT" version control. I'll cover how to use this during the course. Please follow these instructions to [download GIT for windows](windows-git.html)
