# Contact Form Project Specification

I want to make a mobile friendly contact form that asks the visitor 3 questions about why they're reaching out. After the visitor finishes answer the questions, it will send the user a customized response made with ChatGPT, and create one follow up question about on what i want to connect with people around. After they answer the follow up question, it will send a follow up thank you based on how I connect with them.

It will then email me the visitors responses, and tell me why or why not I should reach out to them as a customized intro by chatgpt.

## My Questions

1. What inspired you to reach out today?
2. What would you love to get out of connecting?
3. Is there anything you'd like to share about yourself or your work that could help me understand how we might align?

## Connection Interests

I would like to connect with people around:

- I particularly want to connect with influencers who want to make products
- I want to connect with people who can help me get my AI course out there
