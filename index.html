                <p>I'm a creative technologist with experience teaching at MIT and helping Harvard adopt emerging technologies. When AI tools first became available, I was skeptical. But after building <a href="https://mixcard.me" target="_blank">Mixcard.me</a> using only AI tools, without writing a single line of traditional code, I was convinced of that this is the perfect moment to learn these tools.</p>

                <p>In my course, students have launched their first AI-powered websites in under 20 minutes, regardless of their technical background. If you're ready to turn your ideas into reality with the help of AI, I can't wait to guide you on that journey.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most AI builders give you a flashy prototype but not real control. You can't fix bugs, customize features, or launch something production-ready. This course goes one level deeper â€” giving you just enough power to build, edit, and ship real tools using AI. If you've already started with a builder, you can even take that code and level it up here.</p>

        <h2>About Alfred</h2>
        <div class="modal-body">
            <p><strong>Hi, I'm Alfred!</strong></p>
            <p>I'm a creative technologist who loves teaching and exploring emerging technologies. I've worked at Harvard helping the university adopt cutting-edge tools, and even taught game design at MIT back in the Flash era.</p>
            
            <p>These days, I'm focused on helping people build powerful web apps using AI â€” without writing a single line of code. When I first discovered what was possible, I was skeptical. But then I built Mixcard.me using nothing but AI tools and APIs â€” no traditional coding required. It blew my mind, and I realized this power should be available to everyone.</p>
            
            <p>I've taught this course live, and students were able to launch their first AI-powered websites in under 20 minutes â€” no coding background needed.</p>
            
            <p>My passion is making technology accessible to creative problem-solvers regardless of their technical background. I believe everyone should have the ability to bring their ideas to life without waiting for developer resources or learning complex coding languages.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout my career, I've seen how the gap between "having an idea" and "building the solution" prevents many brilliant concepts from becoming reality. AI is finally bridging that gap, and I'm excited to show you exactly how to use these tools to your advantage.</p>
