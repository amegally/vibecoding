                            <p>I'm a creative technologist who loves teaching and exploring emerging technologies. I've worked at Harvard helping the university adopt cutting-edge tools, and even taught game design at MIT back in the Flash era.</p>
                            
                            <p>These days, I'm focused on helping people build powerful web apps using AI — without writing a single line of code. When I first discovered what was possible, I was skeptical. But then I built Mixcard.me using nothing but AI tools and APIs — no traditional coding required. It blew my mind, and I realized this power should be available to everyone.</p>
                            
                            <p>I've taught this course live, and students were able to launch their first AI-powered websites in under 20 minutes — no coding background needed.</p>

                      Everything you see demonstrates what's possible when you know how to collaborate with AI effectively: the transformation of ideas into reality through intelligent partnership.

                                <p>Yes. Most people who go through this have zero coding experience — and are blown away by what they build.</p>

                                <p>We'll help you find one. You likely have something already — a workflow, a process, a tool you wish existed. This course helps surface it and bring it to life.</p>

                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>Most AI builders give you a flashy prototype but not real control. You can't fix bugs, customize features, or launch something production-ready. This course goes one level deeper — giving you just enough power to build, edit, and ship real tools using AI. If you've already started with a builder, you can even take that code and level it up here.</p>
