                    <div class="section-content">
                      <p>You're not alone. A lot of AI site builders promise the world â€” just write a single prompt and voilÃ : your whole app appears like magic. But here's the catch:</p>
                      <ul class="problem-list">
                        <li>You can't access or edit the code</li>
                        <li>When something breaks, you're stuck in a loop with no way to fix it</li>
                        <li>You get something flashy, but not something launch-ready</li>

                      <p>What we'll show you in this course gives you real control â€” without requiring years of coding knowledge.</p>
                  
                      <p>You'll invest just a couple hours to learn how to go one level deeper with AI. With that, you'll be able to:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Fix bugs instead of giving up</li>
                        <li>Launch an actual, working product</li>

                            <p>These days, I'm focused on helping people build powerful web apps using AI â€” without writing a single line of code. When I first discovered what was possible, I was skeptical. But then I built Mixcard.me using nothing but AI tools and APIs â€” no traditional coding required. It blew my mind, and I realized this power should be available to everyone.</p>
                            
                            <p>I've taught this course live, and students were able to launch their first AI-powered websites in under 20 minutes â€” no coding background needed.</p>

                      Everything you see here was generated and customized through AI prompting, just like you'll learn to do in the course.
